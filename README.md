# MCPExceptionExtractor
Did your MCP fail to decompile / recompile? Is that peskey log file so big you can't send it over Discord? Well look no further! MCPExceptionExtractor is here! **I want to give a big thanks to S1ikn. He is/was working on a similier program, and I wanted to try to do the same task with using REGEX, which I am not familier with.**

## How to use
A) Drag your MCP.log file onto "drag_mcp_log_onto_me.bat". If it succeeds, you should get a mcp.log.formatted file, that you can send over Discord.

B) java -jar MCPExceptionExtractor.jar <fileName | mcp.log>
